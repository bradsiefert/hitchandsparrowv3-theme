              <p>I'm Anthony. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. I absolutely love shared experiences and 
                exploring new places. A few other things I dig: good design, a meal shared with friends, finding 
                tasty cortado’s in every city, Pittsburgh sports, running/biking with good music or a solid podcast 
                playing, the outdoors (hiking, rock-climbing, surfing, throwing/hitting/kicking objects back & 
                fourth, etc.), mid-century modern homes/furniture, a good cocktail (Toronto’s are my favorite), solid 
                beer (bourbon barrel-aged, please), good candles, camp-side conversations, friendships that extend 
                across time & state-lines and my beautiful wife, Laura.

                Photography has given my interests in exploration, storytelling and connecting, a fascinating 
                platform. I'm insanely passionate about what I do and the relationships I get to build in the 
                process. Photographing a wedding with Hitch & Sparrow is a stunning example of this reality. It's a 
                joy to celebrate the marriage process with couples, as I truly see the marriage as more important 
                than the wedding day.

              <p>
                My name is Laura Barlich. I was born and raised in Elgin, IL a suburb of Chicago. At an early age I fell 
                in love with creating art, making music, playing sports and telling stories. Photography revealed to be 
                a beautiful and creative outlet to share experiences in an impactful way.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                After graduating from Illinois State University in 2009, I pursued a career in Art Education and taught 
                High School Art within Chicago Public Schools until 2014. During my time teaching and coaching soccer, I 
                met my husband, Anthony Barlich, which reinvigorated my love for photography. After years of balancing 
                photography, music, teaching and a deep desire to be an artist myself, we decided I’d come into a 
                permanent role with H&S. In addition, I could pursue a few other passions of mine: most notably, music 
                and ceramics.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I officially function as an assistant photographer for Hitch & Sparrow and have been steadily developing 
                and growing my ceramics brand, Neubloom, for the past 2 years. It’s been quite the adventure with so 
                many lessons learned, experiences shared and dreams realized. In our latest adventure, we recently moved 
                to Denver, CO where we will enjoy heavy doses of nature, hiking, soccer, sunshine and endless 
                photographic moments. Feel free to follow my new adventures on instagram, etsy and Facebook!

                Hey, I'm Brad, I’m a Chicagoland native who came to photography after beginning a career as a graphic 
                designer for startups and web companies. I love the technical end of photography: lenses, lights, 
                strobes, triggers, etc. Knowing these concepts has helped me to think creatively even in the midst of a 
                hectic wedding day. I love the run-and-gun challenge that a wedding presents, but my favorite parts are 
                the sweet moments throughout a day where I get to experience the joy of a loving couple.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I’m enamored with beautiful landscapes, captivating portraits, and simple moments between people. On a 
                wedding day, I get to fly into a bride and groom’s world and to capture something they will cherish for 
                the rest of their lives. It’s a challenge and an honor that I don’t take lightly. I’ve done it enough to 
                not get nervous anymore, but I’m still excited and motivated to create something that the couple will be 
                moved by and will love forever.
